# WOLF Pic Size Bot
A Pic Size Bot for WOLF, designed to help checking sizes of posted images for bot content editors.

Uses [Wolfringo library](https://github.com/TehGM/Wolfringo) for connection and MongoDB (using [C# MongoDB Driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/csharp)) for storage.

## Features
View bot features information on [Wiki page](https://github.com/TehGM/WolfBot-Size/wiki#features).

All commands with more detailed descriptions are listed on [Commands wiki page](https://github.com/TehGM/WolfBot-Size/wiki/Commands).

All commands need to have a prefix (currently `!size `) when used in a group. Commands executed in a private message can skip the prefix.

## Development
This bot is under continuous (if sometimes slow) development. Breaking changes might be introduced at any time.
